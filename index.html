<h1> Mi Vu</h1>

<p>
    My name was supposed to be Mimi when I came from the womb, but my name was cut in half when my birth certificate was processed. My mother didn't feel the need to correct is and just rolled with it. So that is how I got this name. Some people call me Mimi (to either avoid their own self confusion, or because they are a cutesy female friend) but I only allow it if I find them ok. My full name is actually Mi Phuong Vu and I like it just fine.
